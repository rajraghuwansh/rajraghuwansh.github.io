Welcome to my page!

Iâ€™m Raghuwansh, a PhD student at University of Luxembourg  exploring the intersection of Geometrical and Topological Deep Learning and the mathematical principles that drive modern AI. My work focuses on understanding and developing theoretical foundations that bridge deep learning, geometry, and applied mathematics.
