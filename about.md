## Intro

I am a PhD student at the University of Luxembourg, working on **Geometrical and Topological Deep Learning** and the **mathematical foundations of artificial intelligence**. My research interests lie at the intersection of deep learning, geometry, topology, and theoretical machine learning.

Previously, I have worked in industry as a **Machine Learning Engineer** and **Data Scientist**, building scalable ML systems and applying data-driven methods to problems in finance, mobility, and forecasting.
