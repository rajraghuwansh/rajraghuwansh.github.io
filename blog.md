## Blog

Welcome! 👋  
This page is a gateway to my writing on research, my interests, and reflections at the intersection of **geometry, topology, and deep learning**.

I’m **Raghuwansh**, a PhD student at the **University of Luxembourg**, exploring the mathematical foundations of geometrical Deep learning. Through my blog, I share insights on:

- Geometrical & Topological Deep Learning Architectures
- Mathematical perspectives on GDL/TDL  
- Interdisciplinary applications of deep learning  in Physics, Biology, Chemistry and Material Science  
- Occasional thoughts on Philosophy, Existence, Spirituality, Consciousness etc
