## Blog

Welcome! 👋  
This page is a gateway to my writing on research, ideas, and reflections at the intersection of **geometry, topology, and deep learning**.

I’m **Raghuwansh**, a PhD student at the **University of Luxembourg**, exploring the mathematical foundations of modern AI. Through my blog, I share insights on:

- Geometrical & Topological Deep Learning  
- Mathematical perspectives on neural networks  
- Research notes, intuitions, and open questions  
- Occasional thoughts on academia and learning
