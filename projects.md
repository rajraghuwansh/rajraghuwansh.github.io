### **Link Prediction in Citation Networks**  
- Predicted missing edges in citation networks using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and semantic information.  
- Ranked **2nd** on **Kaggle** for this project.

### **Twitter Sentiment Analysis on FTSE Stocks**  
- Analyzed the impact of **Twitter posts** from top 500 accounts on the **UK FTSE index** using **NLP** and **time series analysis**.

### **Remote Sensing with Deep Learning**  
- Automated image annotations for **UAV-acquired images** using **UNet** and **PSPNet** models.  
- Achieved a **Kaggle rank of 11** for this project.

### **Tabular Data Generation with CTGAN**  
- Researched and implemented **CTGAN** for generating synthetic tabular data in the context of **Vehicle Telematics**.  
- Presented findings to stakeholders, enabling the creation of synthetic driving data portfolios.

### **Covariance Matrix Adaptation (CMA-ES) Algorithm**  
- Contributed to an open-source implementation of the **CMA-ES algorithm**, a derivative-free optimization technique.  
- Applied the algorithm in an advanced optimization course project.

### **Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery**  
- Developed a **Python-based** strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands using **decision trees**.  
- Outperformed traditional band boundaries by a factor of two, enabling better characterization of brain activity.
