## Projects


### **Graph Neural Network for Finite Element Analysis**  
- Built a **Graph Neural Network (GNN)**-based surrogate model to accelerate parameter search in **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**.  
- Achieved **99.3% accuracy** on simulation data, enabling faster exploration of pressure and temperature parameters.


### **Link Prediction in Citation Networks**  
- Predicted missing edges in citation networks using **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** and semantic information.  
- Ranked **2nd** on **Kaggle** for this project.
